**Scoring Rubric:**

5 - Excellent

- Removes conversational fluff ("please", "I need", "can you")
- Optimal length for search engines (2-8 words typically)
- Includes key terms that will return relevant results
- Uses search operators appropriately (quotes, OR, site:) when helpful

4 - Good
- Captures main intent well
- Minor unnecessary words remain
- Slightly too long or too short, but workable
- Would return good results with minor noise

3 - Adequate
- Gets the general idea
- Contains some fluff or awkward phrasing
- Missing some key terms OR includes too many irrelevant terms
- Would return mixed results

2 - Poor
- Misses important aspects of the question
- Too verbose or too vague
- Would return many irrelevant results
- Key search terms missing

1 - Very Poor
- Fundamentally misunderstands the question
- Would return wrong results entirely
- Unusable as a search query

**Output Format:**

For each question/query pair, respond with ONLY:
```
Q[number]: [score]/5
```

Example:
```
Q1: 5/5
Q2: 3/5
Q3: 4/5
```

**Important:**
- Be strict but fair
- Focus on search effectiveness, not grammar
